# Problem Statement

**Challenges in Current Emergency Response:**

- **Fixed Zones:** Rigid jurisdiction boundaries can delay response across borders.
- **Manual Monitoring:** Dispatchers can be overwhelmed by high call volumes.
- **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Difficulty in identifying rising incident trends in real-time.
- **Resource Allocation:** Inefficient distribution of units during peak loads.

---

# Solution Overview

**AI-Assisted Decision Support System (DSS)**

A web-based command center dashboard that:
+ **Visualizes** incidents in real-time on an interactive map.
+ **Detects** abnormal concentrations of incidents (hotspots) using AI.
+ **Assists** dispatchers with data-driven alerts.
+ **Maintains** Human-in-the-Loop control for final decisions.

> *Focuses on assisting human dispatchers rather than replacing them.*

# Core Features

- **Interactive Mapping:**
  - Real-time OpenStreetMap integration.
  - Direct incident creation via map interface.

- **Incident Management:**
  - Severity Classification: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**.
  - Categories: **Medical**, **Police**, **Fire**, **Traffic**.

- **Dynamic Analysis:**
  - Real-time AI clustering of recurring incidents.
  - Visual indicators for High-Risk areas.

# AI Logic & Hotspot Detection

The system leverages **Google Gemini API**:

1.  **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
    *   Analyzes citizen chat inputs in real-time.
    *   Extracts intent, severity, and category (e.g., "Fire at gas station" -> **High Severity Fire**).

2.  **Generative Advice:**
    *   Provides immediate, context-aware safety instructions (e.g., "Evacuate 200m away").

3.  **Rule-Based Geospatial Clustering:**
    *   **Proximity Grouping:** Incidents within **~300 meters** are clustered.
    *   **Hotspot Detection:** Clusters with high cumulative severity trigger alerts.

# Operational Workflow

1. **Input:** Operator logs an incident (Location, Category, Severity).
2. **Analysis:** System continuously evaluates incident density and weights.
3. **Alert:** AI detects a hotspot and flags it to the dispatcher.
4. **Decision:** Dispatcher reviews the alert and approves resource dispatch.
5. **Resolution:** Field units resolve incidents; system updates status to 'Resolved' and clears hotspots.

# Human-in-the-Loop Design

**Why keep the human involved?**

- **Accountability:** Critical decisions require human judgment.
- **Context:** AI may miss subtle contextual clues (e.g., duplicate calls).
- **Control:** Prevents "automation bias" and allows manual override.

*Single incidents are treated as routine and can be dispatched manually without AI triggers.*

# Technical Architecture

**Frontend Stack:**
- **Framework:** React + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**Data Structures:**
- **Incidents:** Track `Location`, `Severity`, `Category`, `Status`.
- **Clusters:** Aggregated groups of incidents for heatmap generation.
- **Units:** Real-time status (`IDLE`, `RESPONDING`) of emergency vehicles.

---

# Conclusion

**Impact of the System:**

- **Improved Response Time:** Faster identification of critical areas.
- **Better Resource Management:** Data-driven allocation of police/fire/medical units.
- **Scalability:** Adaptable to various emergency scenarios.
- **Simplicity:** Intuitive interface for immediate operational use.
